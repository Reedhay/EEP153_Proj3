## Topic & Goals:

Our project delves into the impact of COVID-19 on food demand in the USA. We started by analyzing prices and nutrition data for 2017, then comparing it with 2021. We focused on civilian, non-institutionalized populations using the WWEIA data. We specifically considered certain patterns such as increase in home cooking, increased job losses, and immune boosting choices to avoid sickness. 

## Our goals include:

- Understanding the impact of COVID on different parameters such as Income Elasticities, Welfare, and Engel Curves considering factors such as Household Composition.
- Identifying foods and prices most affected by COVID and overall consumer patterns.
